					The medieval city of Haarlem is one of the most photogenic destinations in the Netherlands.Easily
					reachable by train (just fifteen minutes from Amsterdam Central Station) Haarlem is often
					referred to as a scaled-down version of its more famous neighbour.<span>
						But to think of it in such
						terms does a disservice to a city that beats with its own vibrant pulse and overflows with
						a rich history, epoch-spanning architecture and a thriving cultural scene all of its own.

				<h2>Taekwondo</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				The name Taekwondo comes from the Korean word “Tae” meaning foot, “Kwon” meaning fist
				or hand and “Do” meaning path or way of. So Taekwondo means “the way of the foot and hand”. The name
				Taekwondo has only been used since 1955 even though this form of martial arts began over 2,000 years ago
				in Korea.

				During the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945) and then the Korean War, the practice of martial
				arts by Koreans was forbidden. Small groups continued to study and teach the art in secret. Taekwondo
				was introduced to the United States in the 1950′s. By this time the word “Karate” had become a generic
				term for the martial arts.

				Tae Kwon Do aims to unite the practitioner’s mind and body into a single, concentrated force capable of
				swiftly overpowering an aggressor regardless of their size, age or strength. Tae Kwon Do is suitable for
				men, women and children and does not require any prior level of fitness or knowledge.

				The practice of Tae Kwon Do improves flexibility and conditioning of the entire body; enhances
				concentration, discipline and self confidence; and promotes good character and ethical conduct.
